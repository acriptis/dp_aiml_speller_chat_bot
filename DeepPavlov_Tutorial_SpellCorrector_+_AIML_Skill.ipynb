        "We are iPavlov, our story started in 2017 when we decided to build a conversational AI framework that on the one hand will contain all required NLP components to build chatbots and on the other hand will be easy to use. Our work resulted in releasing DeepPavlov library. Our lab at MIPT is honored with Facebook AI Academic Partnership and NVIDIA GPU Research Center status. We successfully combine research and extreme coding in our week-long DeepHack.me hackathons — DeepHack.Game, DeepHack.Q&A and DeepHack.RL. We serve a global AI community by organizing NIPS Conversational Challenge to evaluate state-of-the-art techniques in the field of dialog systems and collect open source dialog datasets.\n",
